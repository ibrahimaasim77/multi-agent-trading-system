  # note (updated 2026-09-09): Day 56 elapsed (Day 53 of $0 streak). 104 GUARDRAIL ABORTS.
  # Two drafts confirmed (no-draft anomaly resolved — both routines produced drafts on 9/9).
  # Macro: risk-off continuing (SPY -0.47% → $762.38; QQQ -0.29% → $716.28). FOMC Sep 16 (4 days).
  # META +6.51% ($613.48 → $653.39): Muse AI agent launch (Sep 8 PM). Best setup since DELL 9/2.
  #   Morning agent identified as Tier 1; all gates pass; cash guardrail fires. Capital failure only.
  # AMD +3.03% ($505.74 → $521.08): block lifted per 9/8; premarket -1.11% → Gate 5 FAIL. Missed.
  #   AMD three-session surge: 9/4 +4.67%, 9/8 +5.85%, 9/9 +3.03%. New momentum regime emerging.
  # SMCI -3.33% ($40.26 → $38.92): AVGO chip gate NEGATIVE (-1.04% PM → -1.12% close). Avoided.
  #   Chip gate protocol: carve-out does NOT activate when AVGO < -1%. Standard gate blocks SMCI.
  # Stand-aside: 55/104 = 52.88% (from 53.47%; META missed, AMD missed, SMCI avoided). Daily score: 40.
  # FOMC September 16 now 4 trading days away. Call Robinhood: 1-800-279-1969. Account ●●●●9602.

  # 2026-09-09: +3 candidates (continuing risk-off; stock-picker's market; FOMC 4 sessions away):
  #   META: close $653.39 = +6.51%. Scored "MISSED." Muse AI agent launch (Sep 8 PM). Premarket
  #         +5.17% ($645.18). ALL eligibility gates pass; VIX 16.60 (safe). Tier 1 setup — best
  #         since DELL +15.81% on 9/2. ONLY fail: cash <$50 guardrail (Day 53 anomaly). Capital
  #         failure, not decision failure. Hypothetical entry ~$645.22 → close $653.39 = +1.27% on pos.
  #   AMD: close $521.08 = +3.03%. Scored "MISSED." Structural block LIFTED (per 9/8 journal).
  #         Evaluated fresh: premarket -1.11% → Gate 5 FAIL (< +2%). Gate application correct given
  #         available information at 8:42 AM. AMD is now 3 consecutive sessions +3-5%. Post-block
  #         momentum pattern: AMD trending positive regardless of premarket signal. Gate-structure
  #         limitation, not decision error. Monitor for Gate 5 threshold revision discussion.
  #   SMCI: close $38.92 = -3.33%. Scored "avoided." AVGO premarket -1.04% → chip gate FIRES
  #         (< -1% threshold). Carve-out protocol correctly NOT activated (carve-out requires
  #         AVGO ≥ -1%). SMCI blocked. -3.33% close validates the gate. Protocol working perfectly.
  #   stand_aside: 55/104 = 52.88% (from 54/101 = 53.47%; +3 candidates, +1 correct).
  # 2026-09-08: +2 candidates (geopolitical shock: Iran/Saudi oil strikes; split market day):
  #   AMD: close $505.53 = +5.85%. Scored "MISSED." Structural block carried forward from 9/4 per
  #         protocol. Cumulative 2-session surge: +10.74% (9/4 +4.67%, 9/8 +5.85%). Block now formally
  #         invalid — original premise (7+ sessions underperforming QQQ) broken decisively. LIFT for 9/9.
  #         No-draft anomaly (5th) means catalyst evaluation unverifiable. Decision error + process failure.
  #   SMCI: close $40.25 = +1.67%. Scored "correct." AVGO gate POSITIVE (+2.97%). Carve-out protocol
  #         applied: evaluate SMCI independently when AVGO gate NEUTRAL/POSITIVE. +1.67% in correct zone.
  #         Protocol verified — first post-carve-out correct evaluation.
  #   stand_aside: 54/101 = 53.47% (from 53.54%; AMD miss -0.07 ppts; SMCI correct partially offsets).
  # 2026-09-04: +3 candidates (NFP day; AI infrastructure surge; jobs-report rotation):
  #   AMD: close $477.45 = +4.67%. Scored "MISSED." Gate 5 FAIL (+0.86% PM < +2%) + structural
  #         block (7+ sessions underperforming QQQ). NFP macro rotation drove intraday surge.
  #         Block remains active — one macro-driven day does not reset structural underperformance.
  #   SMCI: close $39.59 = +4.55%. Scored "MISSED." AVGO gate NEUTRAL; morning routine did not
  #         check SMCI premarket (protocol gap). Third consecutive week of SMCI miss. Gate carve-out
  #         protocol revision now urgent: always check SMCI premarket when AVGO gate ≥ -1%.
  #   DDOG: close $212.95 = -0.84%. Scored "correct." PM +6.08% with no named catalyst → faded.
  #         Consistent with CRWD (9/2: -5.42%) and CRM (9/2: -0.36%) gap-and-fade pattern.
  #   stand_aside: 53/99 = 53.54% (pullback; two misses AMD+SMCI; DDOG correct partially offsets).

## Reading the table

- **win_rate_pct** = wins / (wins + losses). Null until first non-scratch trade.
- **stand_aside_correctness_pct** = stand_aside_correct / stand_aside_count. Skipping a flat ticker = correct. Skipping a +5% ticker = missed.
- **system_alpha_vs_spy_pct** = total system return − SPY return over the same window. Positive means the system is beating buy-and-hold SPY.
- **guardrail_aborts** counts the number of times a hard rule (cap exceeded, blacklist, halt detected) prevented a trade. These are protective wins, not losses.
